# smart-order/client-demo

## How to use
### Part 1 : Setting up
1. `cd client-demo`
2. `npm install`

You're also going to need a working copy of angular-cli (aka. ng) installed in your environment (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).

### Part 2 : Browser access
1. `npm start` to build & serve the application. 
2. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.. 

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

Please respect the existing file organization. For instance, move the cli-generated components from src/app/component-name to the appropriate folder (which for a new contract would be src/app/components/views/main/component-name).

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Technologies & Languages Used
